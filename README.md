# ADB & Fastboot install

Installs the ADB and Fastboot binaries on both Linux and macOS.

## Installing

### Mac OS X

This will install the ADB and Fastboot binaries to `$HOME/.local/bin`.
You will be prompted to add this directory to your PATH if it is not already
there.

### Linux

This will attempt to install the adb and fastboot packages if you are on a
Debian-based distribution. If you are not, then this will just get the two
binaries and place them in `$HOME/.local/bin` and you will be prompted to add
that path to your PATH if it is not already.
